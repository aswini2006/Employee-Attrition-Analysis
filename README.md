# Employee Attrition Analysis

This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company or not) based on various HR attributes.

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict employee turnover based on employee data such as salary, age, and department.

### 🔍 Dataset
- **Source**: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about employees' work-related factors such as satisfaction, number of years in the company, work-life balance, etc.

### 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and evaluation
- **Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC

### 📊 Results
- The models will be evaluated based on accuracy and ROC-AUC score to predict whether an employee will stay or leave the company.
